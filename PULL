People asked me over and over for a _pull_ version of the master
source.  The most often stated need was to avoid having to make all
sorts of hosts trust a common one to build local tools from.  (That
is to say there are bone-heads that we don't want to build stuff
on _our_ hosts that work for the same Dept.)

I hate to break it to you, but the same people that you don't want
pushing stuff to you can hose you just as quickly by changing the
repository...

Eh, if it makes you feel good here is how to use a pull version of
the master source.

If you have a Friend that has it all setup ask them to rsyncd it
read-only to you so you can pull it down.  I include the "RBOOT"
script in my /usr/msrc/local .. you can get it from this directory.
I've included my (internal) web page to help my Customers get started.
