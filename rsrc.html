<H1>The Need to Pull</H1>

Even when you do <BOLD>not</BOLD> want to trust the SAC master source
host to install system programs directly on your hosts you may
still want to have access to the latest versions of those tools.

<P>
This document explains how to use the
<A href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</A> utility to pull
the recent master copy of a SAC tool to your platform source
(or your master source) for you to install or inspect.

<H2>Getting started</H2>

You need the source (or a binary for your platform) to <CODE>rsync</CODE>:
SAC caches a copy of the recommended release at:
<A href="ftp://ftp.sac.fedex.com/pub/gnu/rsync-2.3.1.tar.gz">
ftp://ftp.sac.fedex.com/pub/gnu/rsync-2.3.1.tar.gz</A>.
Note version 2.3.2 has been released, but we have not upgraded due
to peak freeze.

<P>
Down-load the source to <CODE>rsync</CODE> and install it someplace in
your search path.  We install it in <CODE>/usr/local/bin/rsync</CODE>
on our hosts.

<P>
To test this application run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rsync rsync://msrc.sac.fedex.com/
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Which should output a table, like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ftp             SA+C ftp spool
<BR>
msrc            the SA+C master source tree
<BR>
Admin           the SA+C master source admin tools
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Getting setup</H2>

You need two toplevel directories to use the pull system.  One to
hold the pull code and one that caches the source you pull down.
We are going to call these <CODE>Admin</CODE> and <CODE>src</CODE>.
They can be placed in any directory you can write.

<P>
These are the steps to initialize these directories:

<OL>
<P><LI>
Make the <CODE>Admin</CODE> directory, I used <CODE>/tftp/Admin</CODE>
in my example below (only becaue /tftp had a lot of space).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
export TOP=<I>some-directory</I>
<BR>
cd $TOP
<BR>
mkdir Admin Pkgs msrc
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>
Build a <CODE>.rsrc</CODE> file to tell the <CODE>rsrc</CODE> script
where to pull sources from.  Later we will install other <CODE>rsrc</CODE>
control files to pull different products from different master source
hosts.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
echo RSRC_ROOT=\"${PWD}/\" &GT; .rsrc
<BR>
echo RSRC_MSRC=\"rsync://msrc.sac.fedex.com\" &GT;&GT; .rsrc
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The FQDN of the master source host might have to be changed to a
local server if you are not on the FedEx Corporate network.

<P><LI>
To provide the <CODE>rsrc</CODE> and <CODE>makeme</CODE> programs
that we'll use to pull down the rest of the master source we
install the bin directory from the master source with <CODE>rsync</CODE>,
and install it in our PATH.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rsync -ra rsync://msrc.sac.fedex.com/Admin/bin/ Admin/bin
<BR>
PATH=$TOP/Admin/bin:$PATH
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>
Test the configuration of the <CODE>bin/rsrc</CODE> program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rsrc -version
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Should output something like:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
rsrc: <I>a revision token from RCS</I>
Control file basename: .rsrc
Read control files:  <I>$TOP</I>/.rsrc

Local directory $TOP/, with
shell preferences from /usr/local/lib/distrib/local.defs
This host w01.sac.fedex.com should be listed in
/usr/local/lib/distrib/distrib.cf:
/home/ksb/Admin/bin/rsrc[120]: distrib:  not found

Remote master source pool is: rsync://msrc.sac.fedex.com
Copied with: rsync --exclude=.rsrc -r $URL/ .

This directory: <I>$TOP</I>/Admin
is made from the URL: rsync://msrc.sac.fedex.com
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If that looks like what you want you can go on, else read the
comments in the <CODE>bin/rsrc</CODE> script about building shell
variables to modify the run-time behavior of the program to get
sources from your favorite site.

<P><LI>
Pull down a test file with <CODE>rsrc</CODE>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cd Admin
<BR>
rsrc -get README Targets Macros Levers
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
View some of those files to be sure they look sane.  If the <CODE>rsrc</CODE>
scrip fails run it with <CODE>ksb -x</CODE> to see what looks wrong.

<P><LI>
You might have to build a <CODE>local.defs</CODE> file someplace
and set the path to it.  You can use something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/etc:$PATH:/usr/ccs/bin
export PATH
umask 022
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To get you going on a Sun.  It <STRONG>must</STRONG> set a PATH
to find the C compiler and local tools.  It should set a umask.


<P><LI>
Stop to build the <STRONG>product</STRONG> side of the system at this
point (come back later to fill in the Admin script and templates if
you are going to create your own master source pool).  You need a
top level master source cache.  I would put it next to the Admin
cache (not under it).  Check the <CODE>-version</CODE> output carefully.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cd <I>$TOP</I>/msrc
<BR>
rsrc -get RBOOT
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
(Once again change the master source hostname if you must.)

<P><LI>
If you don't have <CODE>mkcmd</CODE> installed you can use
the RBOOT script to install the minimal ksb tools.  You must
have <CODE>rsrc</CODE> and <CODE>makeme</CODE> in you search path.
Run it with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ksh -x ./RBOOT
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Note that it trys to <STRONG>install</STRONG> the tools under
<CODE>/usr/local</CODE>: if you don't have permission to install
there you'll have to build with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ksh ./RBOOT DESTDIR=/tmp/myroot
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Which builds a version of the basic stuff in <CODE>/tmp/myroot</CODE>.


<P><LI>
Now pull down any package you like and use <CODE>makeme</CODE> to
build it locally, or configure <CODE>distrib</CODE> to know about
the local platforms and build as I do.
<OL>
<P><LI>Change directory to the location where the source should be.
If the directory structure is not there <CODE>mkdir -p</CODE> down
to the product (for example <CODE>sbp</CODE>).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
mkdir -p local/etc
<BR>
cd local/etc
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><LI>Use <CODE>rsrc</CODE> to get the product, and move into the product's
source.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rsrc -get sbp
<BR>
cd sbp
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><LI>Use either <CODE>makeme</CODE> or <CODE>make</CODE> to build it
locally or across many hosts.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
makeme install
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
make HOSTS=-mnostromo,sulaco,yaruro install
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><LI>Cleanup and cruft: either remove the whole shadow copy, or
make clean.
</OL>
</OL>

<H2>Thoughts</H2>

This really doesn't fix the issue that so many people complained
about: we are still trusting the master source host to hold "pure
and clean" source.  If they put a nasty bit of code in the repositoy
we are going to pull it down and run it.

<P>
The only difference is when.  We'll do it when we choose.  That
might be a bigger problem, because the keeper of the source might
be in the middle of a change.

<P>
I still prefer the push model.


<H2>Known Bugs</H2>

There are some problems with the pull version of the master source!
Almost all of these are problems with "makeme", if you don't use
that script more than from "RBOOT" you'll be happy.

<DL>
<DT>mkcmd's lib
<DD>
The hosttype.m file is processed via distrib on the way over and
doesn't work correcly from an rsrc boot.  I know how to fix it.
<P>
You should edit it by hand, or run <CODE>m4</CODE> over it by hand.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
	vi /usr/local/lib/mkcmd/type/hosttype.m
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<DT>rdist'd bin
<DD>
The hack.ed file suffers from the same issue as above.
<P>
Don't build rdist with <CODE>makeme</CODE>.

<DT>mk's lib
<DD>
Is broken by the rsrc spell for an even larger reason.
<P>
Don't build this withe <CODE>makeme</CODE>
</DL>

<H2>The next steps</H2>

We can pull code from <STRONG>different sources</STRONG> with the
pull system.  In any product or package directory you can build a
<CODE>.rsrc</CODE> control file to force that product's source to
come from a different rsync server (or ftp for that matter).

<P>
Let's look at the shell code in Admin/bin/rsrc.  It reads
the <CODE>.rsrc</CODE> control file in your home directory, and
the first one it finds on the way up to slash.  We put on at
the top of the Admin and msrc directories when we build the caches.

<P>
These control files are shell scrips.  They set variables like:
<TABLE>
<TR></TR>
<TR>RSRC_LOCAL_DEFS</TR>
<TR>RSRC_MSRC</TR>
RSRC_LIST
SRC_MAKEME
VIA_RSYNC
VIA_FTP
RSRC_DISTRIBS
</TABLE>
